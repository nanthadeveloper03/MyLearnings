                (a) <b>Policy risk:</b> Users of Ultrapro may lose money as a
                result of changes to national laws, rules, or macropolicies that
                could affect how digital assets are normally traded.
              </li>
              <li>
                (b) <b>Legal Compliance Risk:</b> Ultrapro users run the risk of

                commitments or guarantees that any transfers will be successful;

                consent.

                out. In the event that this occurs, the User's interests might

              If a satisfactory resolution is not reached and you wish to pursue
              a Claim against Ultrapro Exchange, you must submit a written
              "Notice of Claim." The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and

              seeking; (3) include the original ticket number; and (4) provide

              dispute to arbitration, in accordance with the Agreement to

              Delhi International Arbitration Centre, 1996 ("NDIAC") following
              the NDIAC Rules in effect at the time, which are incorporated into

              Both you and Ultrapro Exchange acknowledge that the arbitrator
              will only have the authority to resolve disputes within their
              jurisdiction, including matters concerning the existence, scope,
              or enforceability of this arbitration agreement or the
              arbitrability of any specific claim.

              email address are returned as undeliverable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any arbitration against Ultrapro Exchange must be initiated by
              filing and serving a Notice of Arbitration following the NDIAC
              Rules within one (1) year from the date when you first discovered,
              or reasonably should have discovered, the act, omission, or
              default that gives rise to the Claim ("Limitation Period"). This
              Limitation Period includes the Dispute Resolution Period specified
              in clause 1.1. If the Notice of Arbitration is not filed within
              this Limitation Period, you will not be entitled to any remedy or
              relief for that Claim. If this Limitation Period conflicts with
              applicable law, the Claim must be brought within the shortest
              period allowed by law. A Notice of Arbitration may be served to
              Ultrapro Exchange following Applicable Laws and service rules.
